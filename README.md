# Nightwalker Coding Austria â€” Lip Reading app at Hackathon 2023

Audio-Visual Hidden Unit BERT model for lips reading task for the Austrian Red Cross challenge
Integrated the model into the web app, passing the video stream from the smartphone to the model, reading the lips and generating
a text passed as a message to the chat.

This application allowed the Red Cross team to communicate in a very noisy environment, when it is not possible to use walkie-talkies

Used AV-HuBERT, FastAPI, Next.js, WebRTC, Vercel, Render
